      <strong>Academic Video and text Summarizer</strong> helps students handle information overload by creating clear, focused summaries. It uses advanced AI (like GPT-3.5/4) to combine video and reading materials for better context. With techniques like RAG and few-shot learning, it outperforms traditional summarizers in accuracy and clarity.
